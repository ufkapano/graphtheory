# graphtheory package

Python implementation of graph data structures and algorithms is presented. 
The minimal graph interface is defined together with several 
classes implementing this interface. 
Graph nodes can be any hashable Python objects. 
Directed edges are instances of the Edge class. 
Simple graphs are instances of the Graph class (several versions).
Multigraphs are instances of the MultiGraph class.
Many algorithms are implemented using a unified approach. 
There are separate classes and modules devoted to different algorithms.

## Problems and algorithms

* Connectivity: connected components, strongly connected components,
cut nodes, cut edges (bridges)
* Cycle detection, topological sorting (DFS, Kahn), 
transitive closure (matrix multiplication, Floyd-Warshall, BFS, DFS)
* Bipartiteness: bipartite graphs detection (BFS, DFS), 
maximum-cardinality matching (Hopcroft-Karp, Ford-Fulkerson)
* Matching: heuristics (greedy for a maximal cardinality matching,
greedy for a minimum weight matching)
* Vertex coloring: sequential (US, RS, CS),
Brooks' theorem (&Delta; colors),
m-coloring (backtracking, exact),
counter method (exact),
LF, SLF, RLF, SL, GIS
* Edge coloring: with the line graph (using vertex coloring), 
sequential (US, RS, CS), 
NTL (using &Delta; or &Delta;+1 colors),
complete graphs (exact),
bipartite graphs (exact)
* Independent sets: backtracking (exact), US, RS, LL, SF
* Dominating sets: backtracking (exact), hybrid (exact), US, RS, LF
* Vertex covers (heuristics): greedy, 2-approximation, LF
* Minimum spanning trees (weighted undirected graphs): 
Boruvka, Prim, Kruskal
* Single-source shortest paths (weighted directed graphs without negative cycles):
